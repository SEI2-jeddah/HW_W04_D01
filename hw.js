// B) Write a function shiftLetters that takes a string and uses .map to return an encoded string with each letter shifted down the
// alphabet by one. Hint: Use Look up the JS functions String.fromCharCode() and String.charCodeAt() .
// see if you can use Ascii code to acomplish this
// ex. shiftLetters('hello') // => 'ifmmp'
// ex. (shiftLetters('abcxyz') // => "bcdyz{"
var shiftLetters = function(string) {
  // code!
};




// PART 2: USE FOREACH IN THE FOLLOWING EXCERCISES

// A) Build a Deck
// Use a forEach() loop within another forEach() loop to build an array representing a deck of cards. A deck consists of 52 cards - 13 ranks in each of 4 suits.
// Then, display a list of every card in the deck. (Hint: Each element of the array should read something like "ace of spades" or "4 of hearts").
// The start of your output should look something like this:
// - ace of clubs
// - 2 of clubs
// - 3 of clubs
// - 4 of clubs
// - 5 of clubs
// - 6 of clubs
// - 7 of clubs
// - 8 of clubs
// - 9 of clubs
// - 10 of clubs
// - jack of clubs
// - queen of clubs
// - king of clubs
// - ace of diamonds
// - 2 of diamonds
// - 3 of diamonds


// B) Word Play
// Create a form where users may enter a sentence.
// Turn that sentence into an array using the split method.
// Then, loop through this array to build a new array out of every word in the sentence that is 3 or more characters in length.
// Finally, reverse the order of the new array, join it back together into a string, and display it to the user.
